# Smart Meeting Preparation Feature
*Product Requirements Document*
**Version 1.0 - July 2025**

## 🎯 Overview
The Smart Meeting Preparation feature enhances our financial consultation platform by automating and streamlining the pre-meeting workflow for consultants. This feature addresses the critical need for more efficient and standardized consultation preparation, ensuring consistently high-quality client interactions.
