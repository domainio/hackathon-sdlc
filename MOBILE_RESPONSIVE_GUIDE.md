md: 64em (1024px)  - Tablets / Small laptops
lg: 80em (1280px)  - Desktop / Large laptops
xl: 96em (1536px)  - Large desktop screens
```

### Touch Targets
- **Minimum 44px** for all interactive elements
- **Proper spacing** between clickable items
- **Visual feedback** for touch interactions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced network requests** on mobile
- **Optimized images** with responsive sizing
- **Debounced resize events** for smooth performance

## Mobile-First Principles Applied

1. **Content First**: All layouts start with mobile content structure
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features are added as screen size increases
3. **Touch-Friendly**: All interactions designed for finger navigation
4. **Performance Conscious**: Optimized for slower mobile networks
5. **Accessible**: Works with screen readers and assistive technologies

## Testing Recommendations

### Mobile Testing
- Test on actual devices (iPhone, Android)
- Use browser dev tools for responsive testing
- Test in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Verify touch targets are adequately sized

### Performance Testing
- Use Lighthouse for mobile performance scores
- Test on slower network connections
- Monitor bundle size and loading times

### Accessibility Testing
- Use screen reader testing
- Verify keyboard navigation
- Test high contrast mode
- Check color contrast ratios

## Browser Support

### Modern Browsers
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### Mobile Browsers
- iOS Safari 14+
- Chrome Mobile 90+
